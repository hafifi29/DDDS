# Driver Drowsiness Detection System (DDDS) 
Drowsy driving is a significant contributor to road accidents, posing serious risks to both drivers and pedestrians. This project aims to enhance road safety by developing a robust drowsiness detection system utilizing an embedded device integrated with AI models.

We used the 68 facial landmarks to detect the eyes of the driver, then we used EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) to detect if the driver is drowsy. If the EAR is less than a specified thresold for a specified period of time we sound a short alarm, if the driver doesn't respond we sound a longer alarm.

For the embedded device we used Raspberry pi board and camera to capture the driver drowsiness and sound an attached buzzer.
